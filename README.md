# Blueprint - The first responsive Craft library

Introducing the first responsive iOS 10 Craft library for Sketch. Ready for both iPhone and iPad. Blueprint works the best with [Craft by Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/craft) but can be used as a standalone sketch template.

**Blueprint serves as a starting point for your designs, so you can customise it to your needs. It is not a complete iOS 10 redraw.**

## So, why should you use this easy to use, pixel perfect, responsive library?

- **It is lightweight**. Only 1.5MB! Other templates/libraries are so huge, you need a map to use them. This UIKit is the exact opposite. It contains only the most essential controllers.

- **It is easy to use**. This UIKit was made in a way so that you don’t have to open various libraries or other sketch files just to go on a copy/paste spree. Just start with this blueprint, or use the Craft Library and you are set.

- **It is easily customisable perfection**. It wouldn’t make sense to have a template which is not 1:1 with current iOS state. Thus *pixel perfection is a must*, but it doesn’t end there. All the layers are connected with layer styles, so all you have to do is to style just one layer and Sketch takes care of the rest.

## Sounds good right?! Lets see what you can find inside.
